Stuff about Java.

Here are some notes on various concepts of Java programming language.
The document is _not_ well organized and I'm not sure about the intended
audience. Nevertheless, I'm just putting down a bunch of stuff related
to Java that I've compiled over a span of a year or so. It's a good idea
to Google for more information on specific points. Some points below
concentrate on some lesser known things that Java _does_ and some focus
on counter-intuitive things that Java _doesn't_ do. A couple of
explanations have been (obviously) taken from StackOverflow.

More to come - duck typing, reflection and how JUnit uses it for
testing, Java robots, multiple inheritance, TimSort (sorting algorithm
currently used to sort arrays in Java SE 7 and on Android), writing own
class Loaders, interesting stuff about garbage collection and more.
